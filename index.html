        <p class="aboutMe">Hello! Welcome to my about me page!</p>
        <p class="aboutMe">
          I was originally born in Maryland. My family and I are all proud Deaf
          people! Throughout my childhood, I grew up near Boulder, Colorado. At
          age 12, my parents decided to move to Israel. I have spent there
          almost half of my life (11 years!) and recently moved back on my own
          to the states to get myself a bachelors degree!
